# RoboCopy (MVVM Desktop Application)

A high-performance, multi-threaded folder synchronization and copying tool built with Python 3.10 and PyQt6. The application architecture strictly follows the **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** design pattern to ensure clean separation of concerns, high maintainability, and reliable asynchronous execution.

## Features

- **Multi-threaded Core Engine:** Leverages a `ThreadPoolExecutor` to perform concurrent, non-blocking file I/O operations.
- **MVVM Architecture:** Separates business/copy logic (`Model`) from user interface layouts (`View`) using a stateful interface layer (`ViewModel`).
- **Responsive GUI:** Offloads long-running copy processes onto a dedicated background `QThread` to ensure the desktop window never freezes.
- **Graceful Cancellation:** Safely halts future file queues on-demand without killing ongoing active transfers or corrupting data.
- **Robust Error Handling:** Recovers automatically from locked or unreadable system files, providing a detailed breakdown summary of successful versus failed transfers.

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.10 or higher
* Windows OS (Optimized; compatible with cross-platform targets)

### 1. Environment Configuration

Clone or navigate to the project directory and create an isolated python virtual environment:

```powershell
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv_robocopy

# Activate the environment (Windows PowerShell)
.\venv_robocopy\Scripts\Activate.ps1

```

### 2. Dependency Resolution

Install the required third-party libraries using the provided requirements ledger:

```powershell
pip install -r requirements.txt

```

---

## Usage

### Running from Source

To execute the graphical user interface application directly using the Python interpreter:

```powershell
python main.py

```

### Running Automated Test Suites

Unit tests use `pytest` and automatically provision isolated temporary test environments on your machine to validate logic states safely:

```powershell
# Install test runner
pip install pytest

# Run automated tests
pytest

```

---

## Building a Portable Executable (`.exe`)

To compile the source files into a singular, independent executable that can run on any Windows system without a Python environment installed, utilize `pyinstaller`:

```powershell
pyinstaller --noconsole --onefile --name "RoboCopy" main.py

```
OR
```powershell
pyinstaller --noconfirm --onefile --windowed `
--name "RoboCopy" `
--icon="assets/logo.ico" `
--upx-dir="." `
--exclude-module PyQt6.QtWebEngineCore `
--exclude-module PyQt6.QtWebEngineWidgets `
--exclude-module PyQt6.QtPdf `
--exclude-module PyQt6.QtMultimedia `
--exclude-module PyQt6.Qt3DCore `
--exclude-module PyQt6.QtQuick `
--exclude-module PyQt6.QtNetwork `
--exclude-module PyQt6.QtSql `
--exclude-module PyQt6.QtXml `
main.py

```

After compilation finishes, locate the ready-to-run file in the newly generated directory:
`./dist/RoboCopy.exe`

## Core Architecture Design & Logic Handlers

### File Locks & Open Windows Access

Windows platforms impose mandatory data locking mechanisms when external processes claim exclusive access to a file.

* If a target file is open exclusively elsewhere, the `Model` captures a `PermissionError`, safely documents the issue within a structured data wrapper (`CopyResult`), logs it gracefully, and continues iterating through the remainder of the pool.

### Abrupt Application Disconnection

Forcing the application window shut during active transfers can leave corrupt, incomplete data fragments at the destination. To prevent this, the architecture maintains a strict cooperative cancellation architecture. Activating **Cancel** trips a thread-safe atomic conditional check inside the running loop, clearing future tasks cleanly and awaiting active pool synchronization before exiting.
